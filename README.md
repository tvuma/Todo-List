# Todo-List
This is a Todo List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks in a simple and interactive way. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks once done. The application is also responsive across different screen sizes, thanks to Bootstrap.
To enhance user experience, the app uses LocalStorage, ensuring that the tasks remain saved even after the browser is refreshed or closed. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence in the browser.
